Note: This mod has not been thoroughly tested for multiplayer use. Please report any issues you come across on the Nexus mod page.

If you have any issues:
Make sure SMAPI is up-to-date.
Make sure GMCM is up-to-date if you are using it.
Make sure you do not have any other mods installed which modify the Special Orders board installation cutscene (occurs on Fall 2 of Year 1 in Town).
You can reach me on the Stardew Valley discord (Vertigon#1851) or on the Nexus mod page.
Please provide a SMAPI log so that I can assist you better.
